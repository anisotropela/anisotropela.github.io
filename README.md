### anisotropela.github.io
This is the repository for my website [anisotropela.dk](https://www.anisotropela.dk). All pages are written in html/css, plus a little JavaScript.
As a template I used [Chaos from owwwlab](https://owwwlab.gitbook.io/chaos-docs/), but added a bunch of extra code and snippets I found around the web.

You're welcome to have a look at the source code, or just to browse the tree of files, if there's something you find useful. If you grab big parts of the code,
please consider supporting owwwlab by paying the $20 for the template.
