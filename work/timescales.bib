abstract = {We present galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) at {\$}z={\$} 4-8 from a rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) selected sample of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}4500 galaxies, found via photometric redshifts over an area of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}280 arcmin{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} in the CANDELS/GOODS fields and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. The deepest Spitzer/IRAC data yet-to-date and the relatively large volume allow us to place a better constraint at both the low- and high-mass ends of the GSMFs compared to previous space-based studies from pre-CANDELS observations. Supplemented by a stacking analysis, we find a linear correlation between the rest-frame UV absolute magnitude at 1500 $\backslash$AA$\backslash$ ({\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm UV{\}}{\$}) and logarithmic stellar mass ({\$}\backslashlog M{\_}*{\$}) that holds for galaxies with {\$}\backslashlog(M{\_}*/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}) \backslashlesssim 10{\$}. We use simulations to validate our method of measuring the slope of the {\$}\backslashlog M{\_}*{\$}-{\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm UV{\}}{\$} relation, finding that the bias is minimized with a hybrid technique combining photometry of individual bright galaxies with stacked photometry for faint galaxies. The resultant measured slopes do not significantly evolve over {\$}z={\$} 4-8, while the normalization of the trend exhibits a weak evolution toward lower masses at higher redshift. We combine the {\$}\backslashlog M{\_}*{\$}-{\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm UV{\}}{\$} distribution with observed rest-frame UV luminosity functions at each redshift to derive the GSMFs, finding that the low-mass-end slope becomes steeper with increasing redshift from {\$}\backslashalpha=-1.55{\^{}}{\{}+0.08{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.07{\}}{\$} at {\$}z=4{\$} to {\$}\backslashalpha=-2.25{\^{}}{\{}+0.72{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.35{\}}{\$} at {\$}z=8{\$}. The inferred stellar mass density, when integrated over {\$}M{\_}*=10{\^{}}8{\$}-{\$}10{\^{}}{\{}13{\}} M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, increases by a factor of {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}+30{\}}{\_}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} between {\$}z=7{\$} and {\$}z=4{\$} and is in good agreement with the time integral of the cosmic star formation rate density.},

abstract = {A universal stellar initial mass function (IMF) should not be expected from theoretical models of star formation, but little conclusive observational evidence for a variable IMF has been uncovered. In this paper, a parameterization of the IMF is introduced into photometric template fitting of the COSMOS2015 catalog. The resulting best-fit templates suggest systematic variations in the IMF, with most galaxies exhibiting top-heavier stellar populations than in the Milky Way. At fixed redshift, only a small range of IMFs are found, with the typical IMF becoming progressively top-heavier with increasing redshift. Additionally, subpopulations of ULIRGs, quiescent and star-forming galaxies are compared with predictions of stellar population feedback and show clear qualitative similarities to the evolution of dust temperatures.},

@article{Somerville2008,
abstract = {ABSTRACT We present a new semi-analytic model that self-consistently traces the growth of supermassive black holes (BH) and their host galaxies within the context of the Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological framework. In our model, the energy emitted by accreting black holes regulates the growth of the black holes themselves, drives galactic scale winds that can remove cold gas from galaxies, and produces powerful jets that heat the hot gas atmospheres surrounding groups and clusters. We present a comprehensive comparison of our model predictions with observational measurements of key physical properties of low-redshift galaxies, such as cold gas fractions, stellar metallicities and ages, and specific star formation rates. We find that our new models successfully reproduce the exponential cut-off in the stellar mass function and the stellar and cold gas mass densities at z ∼ 0, and predict that star formation should be largely, but not entirely, quenched in massive galaxies at the present day. We also find that our model of self-regulated BH growth naturally reproduces the observed relation between BH mass and bulge mass. We explore the global formation history of galaxies and black holes in our models, presenting predictions for the cosmic histories of star formation, stellar mass assembly, cold gas and metals. We find that models assuming the 'concordance' $\Lambda$CDM cosmology overproduce star formation and stellar mass at high redshift (z ≳ 2). A model with less small-scale power predicts less star formation at high redshift, and excellent agreement with the observed stellar mass assembly history, but may have difficulty accounting for the cold gas in quasar absorption systems at high redshift (z ∼ 3-4). {\textcopyright} 2008 RAS.},

abstract = {We present the first results from the new Bolshoi N-body cosmological LCDM simulation that uses cosmological parameters favored by current observations. The Bolshoi simulation was done in a volume 250Mpc on a side using 8billion particles with mass and force resolution adequate to follow subhalos down to a completeness limit of Vcirc=50km/ s circular velocity. Using excellent statistics of halos and subhalos (10M at every moment and 50M over the whole history) we present accurate approximations for statistics such as the halo mass function, the concentrations for distinct halos and subhalos, abundance of halos as function of their circular velocity, the abundance and the spatial distribution of subhalos. We find that at high redshifts the concentration falls to a minimum of about 3.8 and then rises slightly for higher values of halo mass. We find that while the Sheth-Tormen approximation for the mass function of halos found by spherical overdensity is accurate at low redshifts, it over-predicts the abundance of halos by nearly an order of magnitude by z=10. We find that the number of subhalos scales with the circular velocity of the host halo as Vhost**0.5, and that subhalos have nearly the same radial distribution as dark matter particles at radii 0.3-2 times the host halo virial radius. The subhalo velocity function n({\textgreater}V) behaves as V**(-3). We give normalization of this relation for different masses and redshifts. Finally, we use an abundance-matching procedure to assign r-band luminosities to dark matter halos as a function of halo Vcirc, and find that the luminosity-velocity relation is in remarkably good agreement with the observed Tully-Fisher relation for galaxies in the range 50-200km/s.},

abstract = { We present two bright galaxy candidates at z ∼ 12–13 identified in our H -dropout Lyman break selection with 2.3 deg 2 near-infrared deep imaging data. These galaxy candidates, selected after careful screening of foreground interlopers, have spectral energy distributions showing a sharp discontinuity around 1.7 $\mu$ m, a flat continuum at 2–5 $\mu$ m, and nondetections at {\textless}1.2 $\mu$ m in the available photometric data sets, all of which are consistent with a z {\textgreater} 12 galaxy. An ALMA program targeting one of the candidates shows a tentative 4 $\sigma$ [O iii ] 88 $\mu$ m line at z = 13.27, in agreement with its photometric redshift estimate. The number density of the z ∼ 12–13 candidates is comparable to that of bright z ∼ 10 galaxies and is consistent with a recently proposed double-power-law luminosity function rather than the Schechter function, indicating little evolution in the abundance of bright galaxies from z ∼ 4 to 13. Comparisons with theoretical models show that the models cannot reproduce the bright end of rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity functions at z ∼ 10–13. Combined with recent studies reporting similarly bright galaxies at z ∼ 9–11 and mature stellar populations at z ∼ 6–9, our results indicate the existence of a number of star-forming galaxies at z {\textgreater} 10, which will be detected with upcoming space missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope, Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, and GREX-PLUS. },

abstract = { Here we provide the most comprehensive determinations of the rest-frame UV luminosity function (LF) available to date with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at z ∼ 2–9. Essentially all of the noncluster extragalactic legacy fields are utilized, including the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, the Hubble Frontier Fields parallel fields, and all five CANDELS fields, for a total survey area of 1136 arcmin 2 . Our determinations include galaxies at z ∼ 2–3 leveraging the deep HDUV, UVUDF, and ERS WFC3/UVIS observations available over an ∼150 arcmin 2 area in the GOODS-North and GOODS-South regions. All together, our collective samples include {\textgreater}24,000 sources, {\textgreater}2.3× larger than previous selections with HST. We identify 5766, 6332, 7240, 3449, 1066, 601, 246, and 33 sources at z ∼ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, respectively. Combining our results with an earlier z ∼ 10 LF determination by Oesch et al., we quantify the evolution of the UV LF. Our results indicate that there is (1) a smooth flattening of the faint-end slope $\alpha$ from $\alpha$ ∼ −2.4 at z ∼ 10 to $\alpha$ ∼ −1.5 at z ∼ 2, (2) minimal evolution in the characteristic luminosity M * at z  ≥ 2.5, and (3) a monotonic increase in the normalization        log   10     ϕ   *      from z ∼ 10 to 2, which can be well described by a simple second-order polynomial, consistent with an “accelerated” evolution scenario. We find that each of these trends (from z ∼ 10 to 2.5 at least) can be readily explained on the basis of the evolution of the halo mass function and a simple constant star formation efficiency model. },

abstract = {On July 13, 2022, NASA released to the whole world the data obtained by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Early Release Observations (ERO). These are the first set of science-grade data from this long-awaited facility, marking the beginning of a new era in astronomy. Many critical questions unanswered in the past several decades now see the hope of being addressed. JWST will push the redshift boundary far beyond what has been reached by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and in so doing it will lead to the understanding of how the first luminous objects - first stars and first galaxies - were formed in the early universe. The red wavelength cut-off at 1.6 micron limits HST to redshift around 11, which is when the age of the universe was only {\~{}}420 million years. The NIRCam instrument, the most sensitive camera onboard JWST, extends to 5 micron and will allow for the detection of early objects only several tens of million years after the Big Bang should they exist. Among the JWST ERO targets there is a nearby galaxy cluster SMACS 0723-73, which is a massive cluster and has been long recognized as a good "cosmic telescope" to amplify the background, far-away galaxies through its gravitational lensing effect. The NIRCam field-of-view is large enough that the ERO observations have covered not only the cluster but also a flanking field not boosted by gravitational lensing. JWST is so sensitive that the flanking field also sees far beyond HST. Here we report the result from our search of candidate galaxies at redshift larger than 11 using these ERO data. We have a total of 88 such candidates spreading over the two fields, some of which could be at redshifts as high as 20. Neither the high number of such objects found nor the high redshifts they reside at are expected from the previously favored predictions.},

abstract = {Modeling galaxy formation in a cosmological context presents one of the greatest challenges in astrophysics today due to the vast range of scales and numerous physical processes involved. Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semianalytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly cosmic high noon (z ∼ 2-3) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence among different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multiscale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

We investigate several different recipes for star formation and supernova feedback, including choices that are similar to the treatment by Kauffmann, White {\&} Guiderdoni and Cole et al., as well as some new recipes. We obtain good agreement with all of the key local observations mentioned above. In particular, in our best models, we simultaneously produce good agreement with both the observed B- and K-band LFs and the I-band Tully-Fisher relation. Improved cooling and supernova feedback modelling, inclusion of dust extinction and an improved Press-Schechter model all contribute to this success. We present results for several variants of the CDM family of cosmologies, and find that models with values of $\Omega$0 ≃ 0.3-0.5 give the best agreement with observations.},

abstract = {Galaxy groups are not scaled down versions of massive galaxy clusters - the hot gas in groups [known as the intragroup medium (IGrM)] is, on average, less dense than the intracluster medium, implying that one or more non-gravitational processes (e.g. radiative cooling, star formation and/or feedback) has had a relatively larger effect on groups. In the present study, we compare a number of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that form part of the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations project to isolate and quantify the effects of cooling and feedback from supernovae (SNe) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the gas. This is achieved by comparing Lagrangian thermal histories of the gas in the different runs, which were all started from identical initial conditions. While radiative cooling, star formation and SN feedback are all necessary ingredients, only runs that also include AGN feedback are able to successfully reproduce the optical and X-ray properties of groups and low-mass clusters. We isolate how, when and exactly what gas is heated by AGN. Interestingly, we find that the gas that constitutes the present-day IGrM is that which was not strongly heated by AGN. Instead, the low median density/high median entropy of the gas in present-day groups is achieved by the ejection of lower entropy gas from low-mass progenitor galaxies at high redshift (primarily 2 ≲z≲ 4). This corresponds to the epoch when supermassive black holes accreted most of their mass, typically at a rate that is close to the Eddington limit (i.e. when the black holes are in a 'quasar mode'). {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

Reionization proceeds in three stages and occupies a large redshift range from z{\~{}}15 until z{\~{}}5. During the first, ``pre-overlap'' stage, HII regions gradually expand into the low density IGM, leaving behind neutral high density protrusions. During the second, ``overlap'' stage, that occurs in about 10{\%} of the Hubble time, HII regions merge and the ionizing background rises by a large factor. During the third, ``post-overlap'' stage, remaining high density regions are being gradually ionized as the required ionizing photons are being produced. Residual fluctuations in the ionizing background reach significant (more than 10{\%}) levels for the Lyman-alpha forest absorption systems with column densities above 10{\^{}}14 - 10{\^{}}15 cm{\^{}}-2 at z=3 to 4.},

abstract = {We present the large-scale correlation function measured from a spectroscopic sample of 46,748 luminous red galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The survey region covers 0.72 h-3 Gpc3 over 3816 deg2 and 0.16{\textless}z{\textless}0.47, making it the best sample yet for the study of large-scale structure. We find a well-detected peak in the correlation function at 100 h-1 Mpc separation that is an excellent match to the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic oscillations on the low-redshift clustering of matter. This detection demonstrates the linear growth of structure by gravitational instability between z{\~{}}1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction of the standard cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a standard ruler by which we can measure the ratio of the distances to z=0.35 and z=1089 to 4{\%} fractional accuracy and the absolute distance to z=0.35 to 5{\%} accuracy. From the overall shape of the correlation function, we measure the matter density $\Omega$mh2 to 8{\%} and find agreement with the value from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Independent of the constraints provided by the CMB acoustic scale, we find $\Omega$m=0.273+/-0.025+0.123(1+w0)+0.137$\Omega$K. Including the CMB acoustic scale, we find that the spatial curvature is $\Omega$K=-0.010+/-0.009 if the dark energy is a cosmological constant. More generally, our results provide a measurement of cosmological distance, and hence an argument for dark energy, based on a geometric method with the same simple physics as the microwave background anisotropies. The standard cosmological model convincingly passes these new and robust tests of its fundamental properties.},

abstract = {The excursion set approach allows one to estimate the abundance and spatial distribution of virialized dark matter haloes efficiently and accurately. The predictions of this approach depend on how the non-linear processes of collapse and virialization are modelled. We present simple analytic approximations that allow us to compare the excursion set predictions associated with spherical and ellipsoidal collapse. In particular, we present formulae for the universal unconditional mass function of bound objects and the conditional mass function which describes the mass function of the progenitors of haloes in a given mass range today. We show that the ellipsoidal collapse based moving barrier model provides a better description of what we measure in the numerical simulations than the spherical collapse based constant barrier model, although the agreement between model and simulations is better at large lookback times. Our results for the conditional mass function can be used to compute accurate approximations to the local-density mass function, which quantifies the tendency for massive haloes to populate denser regions than less massive haloes. This happens because low-density regions can be thought of as being collapsed haloes viewed at large lookback times, whereas high-density regions are collapsed haloes viewed at small lookback times. Although we have applied our analytic formulae only to two simple barrier shapes, we show that they are, in fact, accurate for a wide variety of moving barriers. We suggest how they can be used to study the case in which the initial dark matter distribution is not completely cold.},

abstract = {The time-scale for galaxies within merging dark matter haloes to merge with each other is an important ingredient in galaxy formation models. Accurate estimates of merging time-scales are required for predictions of astrophysical quantities such as black hole binary merger rates, the build-up of stellar mass in central galaxies and the statistical properties of satellite galaxies within dark matter haloes. In this paper, we study the merging time-scales of extended dark matter haloes using N-body simulations. We compare these results to standard estimates based on the Chandrasekhar theory of dynamical friction. We find that these standard predictions for merging time-scales, which are often used in semi-analytic galaxy formation models, are systematically shorter than those found in simulations. The discrepancy is approximately a factor of 1.7 for Msat/Mhost ≈ 0.1 and becomes larger for more disparate satellite-to-host mass ratios, reaching a factor of ∼3.3 for M sat/Mhost ≈ 0.01. Based on our simulations, we propose a new, easily implementable fitting formula that accurately predicts the time-scale for an extended satellite to sink from the virial radius of a host halo down to the halo's centre for a wide range of Msat/M host and orbits. Including a central bulge in each galaxy changes the merging time-scale by ≲10 per cent. To highlight one concrete application of our results, we show that merging time-scales often used in the literature overestimate the growth of stellar mass by satellite accretion by ≈40 per cent, with the extra mass gained in low mass ratio mergers. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

abstract = {We probe what constraints for the global ionized hydrogen fraction the Void Probability Function (VPF) clustering can give for the Lyman-Alpha Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization (LAGER) narrowband survey as a function of area. Neutral hydrogen acts like a fog for Lyman-alpha emission, and measuring the drop in the luminosity function of Lyman-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emitters (LAEs) has been used to constrain the ionization fraction in narrowband surveys. However, the clustering of LAEs is independent from the luminosity function's inherent evolution, and can offer additional constraints for reionization under different models. The VPF measures how likely a given circle is to be empty. It is a volume-averaged clustering statistic that traces the behavior of higher order correlations, and its simplicity offers helpful frameworks for planning surveys. Using the $\backslash$citet{\{}Jensen2014{\}} simulations of LAEs within various amount of ionized intergalactic medium, we predict the behavior of the VPF in one (301x150.5x30 Mpc{\$}{\^{}}3{\$}), four (5.44{\$}\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}6{\$} Mpc{\$}{\^{}}3{\$}), or eight (1.1{\$}\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}7{\$} Mpc{\$}{\^{}}3{\$}) fields of LAGER imaging. We examine the VPF at 5 and 13 arcminutes, corresponding to the minimum scale implied by the LAE density and the separation of the 2D VPF from random, and the maximum scale from the 8-field 15.5 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} LAGER area. We find that even a single DECam field of LAGER (2-3 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$}) could discriminate between mostly neutral vs. ionized. Additionally, we find four fields allows the distinction between 30, 50, and 95 percent ionized; and that eight fields could even distinguish between 30, 50, 73, and 95 percent ionized.},

abstract = {We present a detailed prescription for the modelling of galaxy formation in hierarchical theories of structure formation. Our model incorporates the formation and merging of dark matter haloes, the shock heating and radiative cooling of baryonic gas gravitationally confined in these haloes, star formation regulated by the energy released by evolving stars and supernovae, the merging of galaxies within dark matter haloes, and the spectral evolution of the stellar populations that are formed. The procedure that we describe is very flexible and can be applied to any hierarchical clustering theory. Our prescriptions for regulated star formation and galaxy mergers are motivated and constrained by numerical simulations. We are able to predict galaxy numbers, luminosities, colours and circular velocities. This investigation is restricted to the standard cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology, and we explore the effects of varying other assumptions, including the stellar initial mass function, star formation rates and galaxy merging. We compare the results of these models with an extensive range of observational data, including the B and K galaxy luminosity functions, galaxy colours, the Tully-Fisher relation, faint galaxy number counts, and the redshift distribution at B ≈ 22. This combination of observed galaxy properties strongly constrains the models and enables the relative importance of each of the physical processes included to be assessed. We present a broadly successful model defined by a plausible choice of parameters. This fiducial model produces a much more acceptable luminosity function than have most previous studies. This is achieved through a modest rate of galaxy mergers and strong suppression of star formation in haloes of low circular velocity by energy injected by supernovae and evolving stars. The model also accounts for the observed faint galaxy counts in both the B and K bands, and their redshift distributions. It fails, however, to produce galaxies as red as are many observed ellipticals and, compared with the observed Tully-Fisher relation, the model galaxies have circular velocities which are too large for their luminosities.},

abstract = {We compute the bispectra of the 21cm signal during the epoch of reionization for three different reionization scenarios that are based on a dark matter N-body simulation combined with a self-consistent, semi-numerical model of galaxy evolution and reionization. Our reionization scenarios differ in their trends of ionizing escape fractions (fesc) with the underlying galaxy properties and cover the physically plausible range, i.e. fesc effectively decreasing, being constant, or increasing with halo mass. We find the 21 cm bispectrum to be sensitive to the resulting ionization topologies that significantly differ in their size distribution of ionized and neutral regions throughout reionization. From squeezed to stretched triangles, the 21 cm bispectra features a change of sign from negative to positive values, with ionized and neutral regions representing below-average and above-average concentrations contributing negatively and positively, respectively. The position of the change of sign provides a tracer of the size distribution of the ionized and neutral regions, and allows us to identify three major regimes that the 21 cm bispectrum undergoes during reionization. In particular the regime during the early stages of reionization, where the 21 cm bispectrum tracks the peak of the size distribution of the ionized regions, provides exciting prospects for pinning down reionization with the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array.},

SAGE is a significant update to that used in Croton et al. (2006) and has been rebuilt to be modular and customisable. The model will run on any N-body simulation whose trees are organised in a supported format and contain a minimum set of basic halo properties. In this work we present the baryonic prescriptions implemented in SAGE to describe the formation and evolution of galaxies, and their calibration for three N-body simulations: Millennium, Bolshoi, and GiggleZ. Updated physics include: gas accretion, ejection due to feedback, and reincorporation via the galactic fountain; a new gas cooling--radio mode active galactic nucleus (AGN) heating cycle; AGN feedback in the quasar mode; a new treatment of gas in satellite galaxies; and galaxy mergers, disruption, and the build-up of intra-cluster stars. Throughout, we show the results of a common default parameterization on each simulation, with a focus on the local galaxy population.},

abstract = {We introduce the Virgo Consortium's Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) project, a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and supermassive black holes in cosmologically representative volumes of a standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter universe. We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy stellar mass function is reproduced to ≲0.2 dex over the full resolved mass range, 108 {\textless} M*/M⊙ ≲ 1011, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C IV and O VI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for M* ≳ 109 M⊙ (M* ≳ 1010 M⊙ at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE simulation suite, which also includes physics variations and higher resolution zoomed-in volumes described elsewhere, constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.},

Collisions and encounters between stellar systems are considered, and two-body realization and the approach to statistical equilibrium in star clusters are addressed. It is shown how the observable properties of galaxies such as their luminosities and colors are changed by the aging of their constituent stellar populations.

abstract = {In addition to the large systematic differences arising from assumptions about the stellar massto-light ratio, the massive end of the stellar mass function is rather sensitive to how one fits the light profiles of the most luminous galaxies.We quantify this by comparing the luminosity and stellar mass functions based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) cmodel magnitudes, and PyMorph single-S{\'{e}}rsic and S{\'{e}}rsic-exponential fits to the surface brightness profiles of galaxies in the SDSS. The PyMorph fits return more light, so that the predicted masses are larger than when cmodel magnitudes are used. As a result, the total stellar mass density at z {\~{}} 0.1 is about 1.2 times larger than in our previous analysis of the SDSS. The differences are most pronounced at the massive end, where the measured number density of objects having M ≥ 6 × 1011M⊙ is approximately five times larger. Alternatively, at number densities of 10-6 Mpc-3, the limiting stellar mass is two times larger. The differences with respect to fits by other authors, typically based on Petrosian-like magnitudes, are even more dramatic, although some of these differences are due to sky-subtraction problems, and are sometimes masked by large differences in the assumed ML (even after scaling to the same initial mass function).Our results impact studies of the growth and assembly of stellarmass in galaxies, and of the relation between stellar and halo mass, so we provide simple analytic fits to these new luminosity and stellar mass functions and quantify how they depend on morphology, as well as the binned counts in electronic format. While these allow one to quantify the differences which arise because of the assumed light profile, and we believe our S{\'{e}}rsic-exponential based results to be the most realistic of the models we have tested, we caution that which profile is the most appropriate at the high-mass end is still debated. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

@article{Efstathiou2000,
abstract = {A model of supernova feedback during disc galaxy formation is developed. The model incorporates infall of cooling gas from a halo, and outflow of hot gas from a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM). The star formation rate is determined by balancing the energy dissipated in collisions between cold gas clouds with that supplied by supernovae in a disc marginally unstable to axisymmetric instabilities. Hot gas is created by thermal evaporation of cold gas clouds in supernova remnants, and criteria are derived to estimate the characteristic temperature and density of the hot component and hence the net mass outflow rate. A number of refinements of the model are investigated, including a simple model of a galactic fountain, the response of the cold component to the pressure of the hot gas, pressure-induced star formation and chemical evolution. The main conclusion of this paper is that low rates of star formation can expel a large fraction of the gas from a dwarf galaxy. For example, a galaxy with circular speed ∼50 km s-1 can expel ∼60-80 per cent of its gas over a time-scale of ∼1 Gyr, with a star formation rate that never exceeds ∼0.1 M⊙ yr-1. Effective feedback can therefore take place in a quiescent mode and does not require strong bursts of star formation. Even a large galaxy, such as the Milky Way, might have lost as much as 20 per cent of its mass in a supernova-driven wind. The models developed here suggest that dwarf galaxies at high redshifts will have low average star formation rates and may contain extended gaseous discs of largely unprocessed gas. Such extended gaseous discs might explain the numbers, metallicities and metallicity dispersions of damped Lyman $\alpha$ systems.},

We present a new model that divides the Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer into a (circum)galactic and an extragalactic (IGM) part, and investigate how the choice of intrinsic line model affects the IGM transmission results. We use our model to study the impact of neutral hydrogen on statistical observables such as the Ly$\alpha$ rest-frame equivalent width (REW) distribution, the LAE luminosity function and the two-point correlation function. We find that if the observed changes in LAE luminosity functions and equivalent width distributions between z ˜ 6 and 7 are to be explained by an increased IGM neutral fraction alone, we require an extremely late and rapid reionization scenario, where the Universe was ˜40 per cent ionized at z = 7, ˜50 per cent ionized at z = 6.5 and ˜100 per cent ionized at z = 6. This is in conflict with other observations, suggesting that intrinsic LAE evolution at z ≳ 6 cannot be completely neglected. We show how the two-point correlation function can provide more robust constraints once future observations obtain larger LAE samples, and provide predictions for the sample sizes needed to tell different reionization scenarios apart.},

abstract = {We simulate the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes by implementing a suite of semi-analytic models on the output of the Millennium Run, a very large simulation of the concordance $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmogony. Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for 'radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological 'radio mode' model to be successful. {\textcopyright} 2005 RAS.},

abstract = {We develop a coupled model for the evolution of the global properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the formation of galaxies, in the presence of a photoionizing background due to stars and quasars. We use this model to predict the thermodynamic history of the IGM when photoionized by galaxies forming in a cold dark matter (CDM) universe. The evolution of the galaxies is calculated using a semi-analytical model, including a detailed treatment of the effects of tidal stripping and dynamical friction on satellite galaxies orbiting inside larger dark matter haloes. We include in the model the negative feedback on galaxy formation from the photoionizing background. Photoionization inhibits galaxy formation in low-mass dark matter haloes in two ways: (i) heating of the IGM and inhibition of the collapse of gas into dark haloes by the IGM pressure, and (ii) reduction in the rate of radiative cooling of gas within haloes. The result of our method is a self-consistent model of galaxy formation and the IGM. The IGM is reheated twice (during reionization of H I and He II), and we find that the star formation rate per unit volume is slightly suppressed after each episode of reheating. We find that galaxies brighter than L* are mostly unaffected by reionization, while the abundance of faint galaxies is significantly reduced, leading to present-day galaxy luminosity functions with shallow faint-end slopes, in good agreement with recent observational data. Reionization also affects other properties of these faint galaxies, in a readily understandable way.},

We explore the galactic bivariate brightness plane (M*-$\mu$), demonstrating that surface brightness effects do not systematically bias our mass function measurement above 107.5 M⊙. The galaxy distribution in the M-$\mu$ plane appears well bounded, indicating that no substantial population of massive but diffuse or highly compact galaxies are systematically missed due to the GAMA selection criteria. The GSMF is fitted with a double Schechter function, with M* = 1010.78±0.01±0.20 M⊙, $\phi$1* = (2.93 ± 0.40) × 10-3 h703 Mpc-3, $\alpha$1 =-0.62 ± 0.03 ± 0.15, $\phi$2* = (0.63 ± 0.10) × 10-3 h703 Mpc-3 and $\alpha$2 =-1.50 ± 0.01 ± 0.15.

Using the full GAMA-II sample, we are able to fit the mass function to masses as low as 107.5 M⊙, and assess limits to 106.5 M⊙. Combining GAMA-II with data from G10-COSMOS, we are able to comment qualitatively on the shape of the GSMF down to masses as low as 106 M⊙. Beyond the well-known upturn seen in the GSMF at 109.5, the distribution appears to maintain a single power-law slope from 109 to 106.5.

abstract = {We present a new release of the GALFORM semi-analytical model of galaxy formation and evolution, which exploits a Millennium Simulation-class N-body run performed with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7 cosmology. We use this new model to study the impact of the choice of stellar population synthesis (SPS) model on the predicted evolution ofthe galaxy luminosity function. The semi-analytical model is run using seven different SPS models. In each case, we obtain the rest-frame luminosity function in the far-ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared (NIR) wavelength ranges. We find that both the predicted rest-frame ultraviolet and optical luminosity function are insensitive to the choice of SPS model. However, we find that the predicted evolution of the rest-frameNIR luminosity function depends strongly on the treatment of the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch(TP-AGB) stellar phase in the SPS models, with differences larger than a factor of 2 for model galaxies brighter than MAB(K) - 5 log h {\textless} -22 (̃L* for 0 ≤ z ≤ 1.5). We have alsoexplored the predicted number counts of galaxies, finding remarkable agreement between the results with different choices of SPS model, except when selecting galaxies withvery red optical-NIR colours. The predicted number counts of these extremely red galaxiesappear to be more affected by the treatment of star formation in discs than by the treatment of TP-AGB stars in the SPS models. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {We present a model for the evolution of the galaxy ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) across cosmic time where star formation is linked to the assembly of dark matter halos under the assumption of a mass-dependent, but redshift-independent, efficiency. We introduce a new self-consistent treatment of the halo star formation history, which allows us to make predictions at z {\textgreater} 10 (lookback time ≲500 Myr), when growth is rapid. With a calibration at a single redshift to set the stellar-to-halo mass ratio, and no further degrees of freedom, our model captures the evolution of the UV LF over all available observations (0 ≲ z ≲ 10). The significant drop in luminosity density of currently detectable galaxies beyond z ∼ 8 is explained by a shift of star formation toward less massive, fainter galaxies. Assuming that star formation proceeds down to atomic cooling halos, we derive a reionization optical depth T = 0.056+0.007-0.010, fully consistent with the latest Planck measurement, implying that the universe is fully reionized at z = 7.84+0.65-0.98. In addition, our model naturally produces smoothly rising star formation histories for galaxies with L ≲ L∗ in agreement with observations and hydrodynamical simulations. Before the epoch of reionization at z {\textgreater} 10 we predict the LF to remain well-described by a Schechter function, but with an increasingly steep faint-end slope ($\alpha$ ∼ -3.5 at z ∼ 16). Finally, we construct forecasts for surveys with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Wide-field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and predict that galaxies out to z ∼ 14 will be observed. Galaxies at z {\textgreater} 15 will likely be accessible to JWST and WFIRST only through the assistance of strong lensing magnification.},

abstract = {The upcoming SKA1-Low radio interferometer will be sensitive enough to produce tomographic imaging data of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization. Due to the non-Gaussian distribution of the signal, a power spectrum analysis alone will not provide a complete description of its properties. Here, we consider an additional metric which could be derived from tomographic imaging data, namely the bubble size distribution of ionized regions. We study three methods that have previously been used to characterize bubble size distributions in simulation data for the hydrogen ionization fraction - the spherical-average (SPA), mean-free-path (MFP) and friends-of-friends (FOF) methods - and apply them to simulated 21-cm data cubes. Our simulated data cubes have the (sensitivity-dictated) resolution expected for the SKA1-Low reionization experiment and we study the impact of both the light-cone (LC) and redshift space distortion (RSD) effects. To identify ionized regions in the 21-cm data we introduce a new, self-adjusting thresholding approach based on the K-Means algorithm. We find that the fraction of ionized cells identified in this way consistently falls below the mean volume-averaged ionized fraction. From a comparison of the three bubble size methods, we conclude that all three methods are useful, but that theMFP method performs best in terms of tracking the progress of reionization and separating different reionization scenarios. The LC effect is found to affect data spanning more than about 10 MHz in frequency ($\Delta$z {\~{}} 0.5). We find that RSDs only marginally affect the bubble size distributions.},

Within the context of this model, recent measurements of the temperature fluctuations have led to profound conclusions about the origin, evolution and composition of the Universe. Using the measured temperature fluctuations, the theoretical framework predicts the level of polarization of the CMB with essentially no free parameters. Therefore, a measurement of the polarization is a critical test of the theory and thus of the validity of the cosmological parameters derived from the CMB measurements. Here we report the detection of polarization of the CMB with the Degree Angular Scale Interferometer (DASI). The polarization is deteced with high confidence, and its level and spatial distribution are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the standard theory.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {As part of the SILCC-Zoom project, we present our first sub-parsec resolution radiationhydrodynamic simulations of twomolecular clouds self-consistently forming from a turbulent, multiphase ISM. The clouds have similar initial masses of few 104M, escape velocities of ∼5 kms-1, and a similar initial energy budget.We follow the formation of star clusters with a sink-based model and the impact of radiation from individual massive stars with the tree-based radiation transfer module TREERAY. Photoionizing radiation is coupled to a chemical network to follow gas heating, cooling, and molecule formation and dissociation. For the first 3Myr of cloud evolution, we find that the overall star formation efficiency is considerably reduced by a factor of ∼4 to global cloud values of {\textless}10 per cent as the mass accretion of sinks that host massive stars is terminated after 1Myr. Despite the low efficiency, star formation is triggered across the clouds. Therefore, a much larger region of the cloud is affected by radiation and the clouds begin to disperse. The time-scale on which the clouds are dispersed sensitively depends on the cloud sub-structure and in particular on the amount of gas at high visual extinction. The damage of radiation done to the highly shielded cloud (MC1) is delayed. We also show that the radiation input can sustain the thermal and kinetic energy of the clouds at a constant level. Our results strongly support the importance of ionizing radiation from massive stars for explaining the low-observed star formation efficiency of molecular clouds.},

abstract = {The formation of dwarf, diffuse, metal-poor galaxies as a result of supernova-driven winds is reexamined in view of the accumulating data on the systematic properties of dwarfs in the Local Group and in the Virgo Cluster. The observed luminosity-radius-metallicity relations, which are easily understood if the gaseous proto-galaxies are self-gravitating, are found to be produced naturally inside dominant halos, with a mass-radius relation that resembles the predictions of the "cold" dark matter cosmological scenario. The theory predicts for the least luminous galaxies a mass-to-luminosity ratio that increases with decreasing luminosity up to {\~{}} 10-100, and only a slow decrease of velocity dispersion with decreasing luminosity down to {\~{}}5-10 km s-1. The critical condition for global gas loss as a result of the first burst of star formation is that the virial velocity be below a critical value on the order of 100 km s {\_}1. In any hierarchial scenario for galaxy formation , this condition leads to two distinct classes of galaxies as observed: (a) the diffuse dwarfs (including the dwarf irregulars that have retained some gas), which mostly originate from typical ({\~{}} 1 {\textless}t) density perturbations ; and {\{}b) the normal, brighter galaxies (including compact dwarfs) which can originate only from the highest density peaks ({\~{}} 2-3 a). This provides a statistical biasing mechanism for the preferential formation of bright galaxies in denser regions (clusters and superclusters), enhancing the clustering among the high-surface-brightness galaxies relative to the diffuse dwarfs. It may help reconcile the observed large-scale distribution and peculiar velocities of galaxies with the flat universe predicted by inflation. The diffuse dwarfs are expected to trace the mass; they should be present everywhere, including in the "voids" which are deficient in bright galaxies. A substantial amount of lost gas is expected to be present in the " voids."}},

abstract = {We present Hubble WFC3/IR slitless grism spectra of a remarkably bright {\$}z\backslashgtrsim10{\$} galaxy candidate, GN-z11, identified initially from CANDELS/GOODS-N imaging data. A significant spectroscopic continuum break is detected at {\$}\backslashlambda=1.47\backslashpm0.01{\~{}}\backslashmu{\$}m. The new grism data, combined with the photometric data, rule out all plausible lower redshift solutions for this source. The only viable solution is that this continuum break is the Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} break redshifted to {\$}{\{}z{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}grism{\}}=11.09{\^{}}{\{}+0.08{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.12{\}}{\}}{\$}, just {\$}\backslashsim{\$}400 Myr after the Big Bang. This observation extends the current spectroscopic frontier by 150 Myr to well before the Planck (instantaneous) cosmic reionization peak at z{\~{}}8.8, demonstrating that galaxy build-up was well underway early in the reionization epoch at z{\textgreater}10. GN-z11 is remarkably and unexpectedly luminous for a galaxy at such an early time: its UV luminosity is 3x larger than L* measured at z{\~{}}6-8. The Spitzer IRAC detections up to 4.5 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m of this galaxy are consistent with a stellar mass of {\$}{\{}\backslashsim10{\^{}}{\{}9{\}}{\~{}}M{\_}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}. This spectroscopic redshift measurement suggests that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be able to similarly and easily confirm such sources at z{\textgreater}10 and characterize their physical properties through detailed spectroscopy. Furthermore, WFIRST, with its wide-field near-IR imaging, would find large numbers of similar galaxies and contribute greatly to JWST's spectroscopy, if it is launched early enough to overlap with JWST.},

Our new and largest 20 co-moving Mpc wide volume contains tens of thousands of star-forming galaxies with halo masses up to a few times 1011 M⊙. The simulated galaxies agree well with observational constraints of the ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function in the Epoch of Reionization. The escape fraction fluctuates strongly in individual galaxies over time-scales of a few Myr, due to its regulation by supernova and radiation feedback, and at any given time a tiny fraction of star-forming galaxies emits a large fraction of the ionizing radiation escaping into the intergalactic medium. Statistically, fesc peaks in intermediate-mass, intermediate-brightness, and low-metallicity galaxies (M* ≈ 107 M⊙, M1500 ≈ −17, Z ≲ 5 × 10−3 Z⊙), dropping strongly for lower and higher masses, brighter and dimmer galaxies, and more metal-rich galaxies. The escape fraction correlates positively with both the short-term and long-term specific star formation rate. According to sphinx, galaxies too dim to be yet observed, with {\$}{\{}M{\_}{\{}1500{\}}{\}}\backslashgtrsim -17{\$}, provide about 55 per cent of the photons contributing to reionization. The global averaged fesc naturally decreases with decreasing redshift, as predicted by UV background models and low-redshift observations. This evolution is driven by decreasing specific star formation rates over cosmic time.},

Our most secure candidates are two {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}UV{\}}{\}}\backslashapprox-21{\$} systems: GLASS-z13 and GLASS-z11. These galaxies display abrupt {\$}\backslashgtrsim2.5{\$} mag breaks in their spectral energy distributions, consistent with complete absorption of flux bluewards of Lyman-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} that is redshifted to {\$}z\backslashapprox13{\$} and {\$}z\backslashapprox11{\$}. Lower redshift interlopers such as dusty quiescent galaxies with strong Balmer breaks would be comfortably detected at {\$}{\textgreater}5\backslashsigma{\$} in multiple bands where instead we find no flux. From SED modeling we infer that these galaxies have already built up {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}9{\$} solar masses in stars over the {\$}\backslashlesssim300-400{\$} Myrs after the Big Bang. The brightness of these sources enable morphological constraints. Tantalizingly, GLASS-z11 shows a clearly extended exponential light profile, potentially consistent with a disk galaxy of {\$}r{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}50{\}}{\}}\backslashapprox0.7{\$} kpc. These sources, if confirmed, join GNz11 in defying number density forecasts for luminous galaxies based on Schechter UV luminosity functions, which require a survey area {\$}{\textgreater}10\backslashtimes{\$} larger than we have studied here to find such luminous sources at such high redshifts. They extend evidence from lower redshifts for little or no evolution in the bright end of the UV luminosity function into the cosmic dawn epoch, with implications for just how early these galaxies began forming. This, in turn, suggests that future deep {\$}JWST{\$} observations may identify relatively bright galaxies to much earlier epochs than might have been anticipated.},

However, no evidence of this transition has been found in many high redshift galaxy surveys including CFHTLS, CANDELS and SPLASH, the first studies to probe the high-mass end at these redshifts.

We consider various systematics in the stellar synthesis models used to estimate physical parameters and possible galaxy formation scenarios in an effort to reconcile observation with theory. Although known uncertainties can greatly reduce the disparity between recent observations and cold dark matter merger simulations, even taking the most conservative view of the observations, there remains considerable tension with current theory.},

Based on {\$}0.6-5\backslashmu{\$}m photometry, this strikingly luminous ({\$}\backslashapprox{\$}26 mag) galaxy appears to lie at {\$}z\backslashapprox17{\$}. This would make it an {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}UV{\}}{\}}\backslashapprox-22{\$}, {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\}}\backslashapprox5\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}9{\}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\}}{\$} system that formed a mere {\$}\backslashsim220{\$} Myrs after the Big Bang. The implied number density of this galaxy and its analogues challenges virtually every early galaxy evolution model that assumes {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM cosmology. However, there is strong environmental evidence supporting a secondary redshift solution of {\$}z\backslashapprox5{\$}: all three of the galaxy's nearest neighbors at {\$}{\textless}2.5{\$}" have photometric redshifts of {\$}z\backslashapprox5{\$}. Further, we show that CEERS-1749 may lie in a {\$}z\backslashapprox5{\$} protocluster that is {\$}\backslashgtrsim5\backslashtimes{\$} overdense compared to the field. Intense line emission at {\$}z\backslashapprox5{\$} from a quiescent galaxy harboring ionized gas, or from a dusty starburst, may provide satisfactory explanations for CEERS-1749's photometry. The emission lines at {\$}z\backslashapprox5{\$} conspire to boost the {\$}{\textgreater}2\backslashmu{\$}m photometry, producing an apparent blue slope as well as a strong break in the SED. Such a perfectly disguised contaminant is possible only in a narrow redshift window ({\$}\backslashDelta z\backslashlesssim0.1{\$}), implying that the permitted volume for such interlopers may not be a major concern for {\$}z{\textgreater}10{\$} searches, particularly when medium-bands are deployed. If CEERS-1749 is confirmed to lie at {\$}z\backslashapprox5{\$}, it will be the highest-redshift quiescent galaxy, or one of the lowest mass dusty galaxies of the early Universe detected to-date. Both redshift solutions of this intriguing galaxy hold the potential to challenge existing models of early galaxy evolution, making spectroscopic follow-up of this source critical.},

abstract = {We study the prospects for constraining the ionized fraction of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z {\textgreater} 6 with the next generation of large Ly$\alpha$ emitter surveys. We make predictions for the upcoming Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Ly$\alpha$ survey and a hypothetical spectroscopic survey performed with the JamesWebb Space Telescope (JWST). Considering various scenarios where the observed evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function of Ly$\alpha$ emitters at z {\textgreater} 6 is explained partly by an increasingly neutral IGM and partly by intrinsic galaxy evolution, we show how clustering measurements will be able to distinguish between these scenarios. We find that the HSC survey should be able to detect the additional clustering induced by a neutral IGM if the global IGM neutral fraction is greater than {\~{}}20 per cent at z=6.5. If measurements of the Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths (EWs) are also available, neutral fractions as small as 10 per cent may be detectable by looking for correlation between the EW and the local number density of objects. In this case, if it should turn out that the IGM is significantly neutral at z = 6.5 and the intrinsic EW distribution is relatively narrow, the observed EWs can also be used to construct a map of the locations and approximate sizes of the largest ionized regions. For the JWST survey, the results appear a bit less optimistic. Since such surveys probe a large range of redshifts, the effects of the IGM will be mixed up with any intrinsic galaxy evolution that is present, making it difficult to disentangle the effects. However, we show that a survey with the JWST will have a possibility of observing a large group of galaxies at z {\~{}} 7, which would be a strong indication of a partially neutral IGM.},

abstract = {Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of the stellar mass of bright galaxies was already in place at z {\textgreater} 1. This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation because massive haloes are assembled late in the hierarchical clustering process intrinsic to the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology. In this paper, we discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AON) is assumed to quench cooling flows in massive haloes. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy luminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the Millennium N-body simulation. The accurate dark matter merger trees and large number of realizations of the galaxy formation process enabled by this simulation result in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of the local galaxy population, we investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and galaxy stellar mass functions. We calculate the volume-averaged star formation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in which this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift z ∼ 5 and a star formation rate density which rises at least out to z ∼ 2 in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these properties have been cited as evidence for 'antihierarchical' galaxy formation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally hierarchical CDM model provides a very good match to these observations. {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},

Using these templates, the best-fit redshifts are similar to those found with previous template sets, but the inferred stellar masses drop by as much as 1-1.6 dex, so that stellar masses are no longer seemingly inconsistent with {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM. The two new template sets are released in formats compatible with EAZY and LePhare.},

abstract = {The first galaxies to appear in the Universe at redshifts z {\textgreater} 20 created ionized bubbles in the intergalactic medium of neutral hydrogen left over from the Big Bang. The ionized bubbles grew with time, surrounding clusters of dwarf galaxies and eventually overlapped quickly throughout the Universe over a narrow redshift interval near z ≈ 6. This event signalled the end of the reionization epoch when the Universe was a billion years old. Measuring the size distribution of the bubbles at their final overlap phase is a focus of forthcoming programmes to observe highly redshifted radio emission from atomic hydrogen. Here we show that the combined constraints of cosmic variance and light travel time imply an observed bubble size at the end of the overlap epoch of ∼10 physical Mpc, and a scatter in the observed redshift of overlap along different lines-of-sight of ∼0.15. This scatter is consistent with observational constraints from recent spectroscopic data on the farthest known quasars. This implies that future radio experiments should be tuned to a characteristic angular scale of 0.5 degrees and have a minimum frequency bandwidth of ∼8 MHz for an optimal detection of 21-cm flux fluctuations near the end of reionization.},

abstract = {Recent JWST observations suggest an excess of {\$}z\backslashgtrsim10{\$} galaxy candidates above most theoretical models. Here, we explore how the interplay between halo formation timescales, star formation efficiency and dust attenuation affects the properties and number densities of galaxies we can detect in the early universe. We calculate the theoretical upper limit on the UV luminosity function, assuming star formation is 100{\%} efficient and all gas in halos is converted into stars, and that galaxies are at the peak age for UV emission ({\~{}}10 Myr). This upper limit is {\~{}}4 orders of magnitude greater than current observations, implying these are fully consistent with star formation in {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM cosmology. In a more realistic model, we use the distribution of halo formation timescales derived from extended Press-Schechter theory as a proxy for star formation rate (SFR). We predict that the galaxies observed so far at {\$}z\backslashgtrsim10{\$} are dominated by those with the fastest formation timescales, and thus most extreme SFRs and young ages. These galaxies can be upscattered by {\~{}}1.5 mag compared to the median UV magnitude vs halo mass relation. This likely introduces a selection effect at high redshift whereby only the youngest ({\$}\backslashlesssim{\$}10 Myr), most highly star forming galaxies (specific SFR{\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$}30 Gyr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}) have been detected so far. Furthermore, our modelling suggests that redshift evolution at the bright end of the UV luminosity function is substantially affected by the build-up of dust attenuation. We predict that deeper JWST observations (reaching m{\~{}}30) will reveal more typical galaxies with relatively older ages ({\~{}}100 Myr) and less extreme specific SFRs ({\~{}}10 Gyr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} for a {\$}M{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}UV{\}}{\$} {\~{}} -20 galaxy at z{\~{}}10).},

abstract = {Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations at present usually employ either the Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique or Eulerian hydrodynamics on a Cartesian mesh with (optional) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Both of these methods have disadvantages that negatively impact their accuracy in certain situations, for example the suppression of fluid instabilities in the case of SPH, and the lack of Galilean invariance and the presence of overmixing in the case of AMR. We here propose a novel scheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a finite-volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme is equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second-order accuracy. If they instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian formulation of continuum hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion limitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our new method is fully Galilean invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a property that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations where highly supersonic bulk flows are common. In addition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and continuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of SPH for simulations of cosmological structure growth. The high accuracy of Eulerian methods in the treatment of shocks is also retained, while the treatment of contact discontinuities improves. We discuss how this approach is implemented in our new code arepo, both in 2D and in 3D, and is parallelized for distributed memory computers. We also discuss techniques for adaptive refinement or de-refinement of the unstructured mesh. We introduce an individual time-step approach for finite-volume hydrodynamics, and present a high-accuracy treatment of self-gravity for the gas that allows the new method to be seamlessly combined with a high-resolution treatment of collisionless dark matter. We use a suite of test problems to examine the performance of the new code and argue that the hydrodynamic moving-mesh scheme proposed here provides an attractive and competitive alternative to current SPH and Eulerian techniques. {\textcopyright} 2009 RAS.},

abstract = {(abridged) We present measurements of galaxy-galaxy lensing from early commissioning imaging data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We measure a mean tangential shear around a stacked sample of foreground galaxies in three bandpasses out to angular radii of 600'', detecting the shear signal at very high statistical significance. The shear profile is well described by a power-law. A variety of rigorous tests demonstrate the reality of the gravitational lensing signal and confirm the uncertainty estimates. We interpret our results by modeling the mass distributions of the foreground galaxies as approximately isothermal spheres characterized by a velocity dispersion and a truncation radius. The velocity dispersion is constrained to be 150-190 km/s at 95{\%} confidence (145-195 km/s including systematic uncertainties), consistent with previous determinations but with smaller error bars. Our detection of shear at large angular radii sets a 95{\%} confidence lower limit {\$}s{\textgreater}140{\^{}}{\{}\backslashprime\backslashprime{\}}{\$}, corresponding to a physical radius of {\$}260h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} kpc, implying that galaxy halos extend to very large radii. However, it is likely that this is being biased high by diffuse matter in the halos of groups and clusters. We also present a preliminary determination of the galaxy-mass correlation function finding a correlation length similar to the galaxy autocorrelation function and consistency with a low matter density universe with modest bias. The full SDSS will cover an area 44 times larger and provide spectroscopic redshifts for the foreground galaxies, making it possible to greatly improve the precision of these constraints, measure additional parameters such as halo shape, and measure the properties of dark matter halos separately for many different classes of galaxies.},

abstract = {We measure the mass function of dark matter halos in a large set of collisionless cosmological simulations of flat LCDM cosmology and investigate its evolution at z{\textless}{\~{}}2. Halos are identified as isolated density peaks, and their masses are measured within a series of radii enclosing specific overdensities. We argue that these spherical overdensity masses are more directly linked to cluster observables than masses measured using the friends-of-friends algorithm (FOF), and are therefore preferable for accurate forecasts of halo abundances. Our simulation set allows us to calibrate the mass function at z=0 for virial masses in the range 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} Msol/h {\textless} M {\textless} 10{\^{}}{\{}15{\}} Msol/h, to {\textless}{\~{}} 5{\%}. We derive fitting functions for the halo mass function in this mass range for a wide range of overdensities, both at z=0 and earlier epochs. In addition to these formulae, which improve on previous approximations by 10-20{\%}, our main finding is that the mass function cannot be represented by a universal fitting function at this level of accuracy. The amplitude of the "universal" function decreases monotonically by {\~{}}20-50{\%}, depending on the mass definition, from z=0 to 2.5.
