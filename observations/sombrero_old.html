<h1>Sombrero Galaxy (M104)</h1>
<hr>

<p>

This brilliant galaxy was named the Sombrero Galaxy because of its appearance.
We view it from just 6 degrees south of its
equatorial plane, which is outlined by a rather thick dark rim of obscuring
dust.<br>
<br>
The Sombrero Galaxy has an unusually
pronounced bulge with an extended and richly populated globular cluster system -
several hundred can be counted in long exposures from big telescopes. <br>
<br>
The galaxy was the first one found, by Vesto M. Slipher
in 1912, to be moving away from us so at such high speed (about 1000 km/s)that
it could not be an 
object in our own Galaxy. This formed the basis of the theory that our Universe
is expanding.
