<h1>Globular Clusters</h1>
<hr>
A globular cluster is a spherical bundle of stars that orbits a galaxy as a
satellite. Globular clusters are very tightly gravitationally bound, which gives
them their spherical shape, and extremely dense (in relative terms) towards
their core.<br>
<br>
Globular clusters are usually composed of hundreds of thousands of old
stars, thus exhibiting very red colors.
They are are fairly numerous; there are about 150 currently known
globulars of the Milky Way (with perhaps 10-20 more undiscovered)<br>
<br>
Below are 4 globular clusters taken with the Danish 1.5m telescope in Chile<br>

    <h3>M9</h3>

    <br>
    M9 was discovered by Charles Messier and added to his catalogue in 1764. It is
    one of the globular clusters closest to the nucleus of
    our Galaxy, being only 5500 light years from the centre.

    <h3>M14</h3>

    <br>
    M14 is a globular cluster in the Ophiuchus
    constellation. At a distance of about 30,000 light years, it contains several
    100,000 stars. In 1938, a <a Href="../Encyclo/Nova.html">nova</a>
    appeared in this globular cluster.

    <h3>M53</h3>

    <br>
    M53 is a globular cluster in the Coma Berenices constellation. It was discovered
    by Johann Elert Bode in 1775 . M53 is one of the more outlying globular
    clusters, being about 60,000 light years away from the Galactic Center, and
    almost the same 
    distance (about 58,000 light years) from the Solar system.

    <br>
    This is the last globular cluster. It's just that I promised Johan to take
    these images to use for various bachelor projects.
