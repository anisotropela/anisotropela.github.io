<h1>Supernova</h1>

<p><font Size="+1"> 

The death explosion of a massive star having exhausted all of its fuel, causing it to brighten up
enormously and then gradually fade. At peak light output, supernova explosions can outshine a galaxy.
<br><br>

The outer layers of the exploding star are blasted out in a radioactive cloud. This expanding cloud, 
visible long after the initial explosion fades from view, forms a "supernova remnant".<br><br>

Historically, supernovae were referred to as 
"novae" or "new stars", while the Chinese referred to them as "guest stars". Important supernova in the 
past were:<br> 
<li>in 134 B.C., observed by Hipparchus, which led him to make a catalog of stellar positions;<br> 
<li>in 1054 A.D. in the constellation of Taurus, leaving behind the supernova remnant now known as the Crab 
Nebula. This supernova was observed for several days in the daytime by the Chinese and 
Pueblo Indians in New Mexico, though not a single European recording exists; <br> 
<li>and in 1572, observed by 
Tycho Brahe who found the object had  to be at a distance comparable to the stars. <br><br>
