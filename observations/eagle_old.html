<h1>Eagle Nebula (M16)</h1>
<hr>

<p>
  The Eagle Nebula (NOT a planetary nebula) is an immense structure of pillars of gas and dust
  located some 7000 lightyears away toward the constellation Serpens.<br>
  <br>
  Click <a href="./eagle_sketch.gif">here</a> if you can't see the eagle.<br>
  <br>
  The Eagle Nebula is a site of new star formation. The pillars, several lightyears long,  are concentrations
  of dense molecular gas, which are able to withstand the effects of the intense
  ultraviolet light emitted by newly-formed hot, massive stars, located
  above the nebula. <br>
  <br>
  The knots and filaments on the surfaces of the pillars are formed as
  the surface of the pillars - heated by the hot stars - boils away.
  The image was take with a B, a V, and an R-filter, letting through the blue,
  the green, and the red light. respectively.<br>
  <br>
  The red spot in the eagle's butt is due to gas being heated and ionized from a jet coming
  from a protostar in the bottom of the image. This protostar is itself hidden in the dust,
  but is visible in infrared images.

  The second image was taken with an H&alpha; filter, emphasizing star-forming regions.

  In the third image I used an OIII, an H&alpha;, and an H&delta; filter.
