<h1>Ant Nebula</h1>
<hr>

<p>
A remarkable bipolar or "butterfly"<a Href="../Encyclo/PN.html"> planetary nebula</a> 
in the constellation Norma,
whose outflow speeds, of up to 3.5 million km/hour, surpass those of any other
known object of its type.<br>
<br>

Two main theories contend to explain the intriguing double-lobe symmetry of the
ejected nebula:<br>
<br>
One is that the central star of the Ant has a close companion whose
strong gravitational force shapes the gas flowing out from the primary. If this
is the case, the companion must be so close, at about the distance of Earth from
the Sun, that it may actually orbit inside its partner's bloated atmosphere.<br>
<br>
The other theory is that as the dying star spins, its powerful magnetic field is
twisted into complex shapes like strands of spaghetti. The outflowing gas is
then forced to trace out these intricate patterns, making them visible in the
process. <br>
<br>
A third, and not less interesting theory, is given by The Christian Brethren:
The shape of this nebula can't be explained with the help of current theories,
and it shows clearly that this celestial body was created by God.
